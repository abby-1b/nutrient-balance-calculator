"Low soil level indicates that the nutrient is probably deficient and that the deficiency will likely limit crop growth;  Nutrient levels are: N total  (%) < 0.1,  P Bray I (ppm) <10, P Bray II (ppm) < 20, P Olsen (ppm) < 12, K (ppm) <78 and Mg (ppm) <180.",,,,,,,
"Medium soil level indicates that the nutrient is probably adequate and will likely not limit crop growth in a typical growing season. Nutrient levels are: N total  (%) 0.1-0.2, P Bray I (ppm) 10-20, P Bray II (ppm) 20-40, P Olsen (ppm) < 12, K (ppm) <78 and Mg (ppm) <180.",,,,,,,
"High soil level indicates that the nutrient is more than adequate and will not limit crop growth. Nutrient levels are: N total  (%) > 0.2,  P Bray I (ppm) >20, P Bray II (ppm) >40, P Olsen (ppm) >35, K (ppm) >156 and Mg (ppm) >300 .",,,,,,,
